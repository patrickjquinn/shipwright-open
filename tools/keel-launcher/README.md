# keel-launcher: how the Qt 6 apps get their window

Keel's `ApplicationWindow` is an `Item`, not a window
(`keel/silica/qml/ApplicationWindow.qml`). An app that loads it as the root
of a `QQmlApplicationEngine` shows no main window. On a desktop nothing
appears. On a phone only the cover would be mapped and the app would have no
Lipstick app window. The apps therefore start the way a Sailfish SDK app
does: `SailfishApp::application()` and `SailfishApp::createView()` from Keel's
SailfishApp library (`keel/sailfishapp`). `createView()` returns a
`QQuickView` that sizes the root item to itself. This is the same shape
`keel new` generates (`tools/keel-dev/templates/app/cpp/launcher.cpp`).

Apps: `reef/client/app`, `shoal/keys/app`, `shoal/mail/app`,
`shoal/migrate/app`, `shoal/bridge-icloud/app`.

| Piece | Where |
| --- | --- |
| `keel_show_main_view(qmlPath)` | Each app's `cpp/launcher.{h,cpp}`. The files are identical apart from the include prefix. It loads the file into the view: full screen on a phone (Keel's direct mode or keel-shell, `Keel::windowMode()`), otherwise a phone-sized window, and it honours `keel run`'s `KEEL_RUN_SIZE`, `KEEL_RUN_ORIENTATION` and `KEEL_RUN_SCREENSHOT`. A load error prints the QML errors and returns false. The Rust `main` then exits with status 1. A root that is not an `Item` (a smoke-test harness `QtObject`) is created in the view's engine and not shown. |
| `keel_application()`, `keel_launch_arguments()` | Same files: `Keel::application()` and `Keel::launchArguments()` (`keel/sailfishapp/include/keellauncher.h`). The application is booster-keel's when the app is boosted, otherwise created on the first call (direct mode on Sailfish OS, ADR-0016). |
| Rust side | Each app's `src/bridge.rs` declares the three functions and includes `launcher.rs` from here: `launch_args()` (use it, not `std::env::args()`, which holds the booster's arguments when boosted) and `keel_application()`. `launcher.rs` also has `keel_main(run)`, which the C `main` in the app's `src/lib.rs` calls: it ignores SIGPIPE and turns a panic into exit status 101, as Rust's start code for a binary would. `run` parses `launch_args()`, takes the application from `keel_application()` and calls `keel_show_main_view` instead of `QQmlApplicationEngine::load`. |
| Linking | `link_sailfishapp.rs` here, pulled into each app's `build.rs` with `include!`. Its header lists where the library comes from. Each app is a library crate built only as a `cdylib` (`[lib] crate-type = ["cdylib"]`; an `rlib` next to it would turn off release LTO), and `executable_cdylib()` makes that shared library executable too (`Scrt1.o`, a `.interp` section): the RPM installs `target/<triple>/release/lib<crate>.so` as `/usr/bin/<app>`, and booster-keel `dlopen()`s the same file and calls its `main`. A Rust binary cannot be boosted: rustc compiles it with local-exec TLS, which a shared object cannot hold (a release build fails to link with `-shared`) and which would break in the booster. On a host, `cargo build` gives `target/debug/lib<crate>.so`; run it directly (under the app's name, as the smoke tests do with a symlink: Keel names the application after `argv[0]`) or with `keel run`. There is no `cargo run`. |
| Regression test | `tools/window-probe/`. Each app's smoke test runs the real app library with the real main QML and fails unless a visible top-level window whose title does not start with `keel:cover` appears. |

## Where libkeel-sailfishapp comes from

First match wins:

1. `KEEL_SAILFISHAPP_INCLUDEDIR` and `KEEL_SAILFISHAPP_LIBDIR`.
2. A Keel CMake build in `KEEL_BUILD_DIR`.
3. On hosts only: `~/.cache/keel-dev/keel-build`, then `pkg-config keel-sailfishapp`.
4. Otherwise `keel/sailfishapp/src/sailfishapp.cpp` from this repository is
   compiled into the build-script output directory. It uses cc's compiler for
   the target and the Qt that `qmake` reports.

Case 4 is what CI and the Sailfish SDK build use. Neither needs a Keel
package installed at build time. In the SDK, `cxxqt-sailfish.sh` sets the
cross compiler and a `qmake` stand-in for the target's Qt. That copy is only
linked against. On the phone, the binary loads
`/usr/lib64/libkeel-sailfishapp.so.1` from `shipwright-keel-sailfishapp`,
built from the same source. That package is in each spec's `Requires`.
