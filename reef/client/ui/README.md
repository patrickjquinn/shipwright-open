# Reef client UI

The Reef store client's QML, written against Keel (`import Sailfish.Silica 1.0` under Qt6, versionless `import QtQuick`). It uses Keel's Silica components: ApplicationWindow, Page, PageStack, Dialog, DialogHeader, PageHeader, PullDownMenu, MenuItem, ContextMenu, SilicaFlickable, SilicaListView, VerticalScrollDecorator, ListItem, Label, Theme, CoverBackground, CoverActionList, CoverAction, TextField (with `EnterKey`), TextSwitch, ComboBox, Button, SectionHeader, DetailItem, RemorsePopup, BusyIndicator, ProgressBar, ProgressCircle, Icon and ViewPlaceholder. The pages follow the Sailfish UI rules (`tools/lint/lint.sh style`). Everything else is plain QtQuick (`Column`, `Row`, `Repeater`, `Item`).

**Developer text is plain text.** Titles, summaries, descriptions, categories, publishers and permission names come from developers' RPMs and the unsigned catalogue. The window sets `_defaultLabelFormat: Text.PlainText`, so every Silica label (PageHeader, SectionHeader, ViewPlaceholder, ListItem rows) shows markup as text; the delegates and the description also set `textFormat: Text.PlainText` explicitly. A catalogue cannot make the store load remote images or show links.

**Assets.** Icons and screenshots are the only images, and they come from the pinned repository alone: the catalogue names them by a path relative to its own directory (`assets/...`, checked by `catalogue::is_asset_path`, never a URL), the Rust side downloads them during a refresh from that directory (`jobs::fetch_assets`: PNG or JPEG by magic number, 2 MB at most, cached under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/shipwright-reef/assets/`), and the UI shows the cached local files (`iconPath`, `screenshotPaths`). A path not cached yet is empty, and `AppIcon` shows the app's initial instead.

**Links.** Only `https://` URLs are opened (`components/Texts.js`, `isHttps` and `openHttps`); the Homepage, Source and Buy actions are hidden for anything else. reef-backend drops non-https homepage and source links and refuses a non-https purchase URL when it parses the catalogue, and `tools/build/reef/gen-catalogue.py` refuses or drops them at publish time.

**Translation.** The Rust side sends keys, not English, for what it says itself (`busyText`, and the fixed messages in `lastError` and `operationFinished`), and `components/Texts.js` maps them to `qsTr` strings. Errors that come from PackageKit, the network or reef-licence are shown as they are.

**Errors.** A failed install, update or remove is shown on the package page and in `lastError` (shown on the catalogue, installed and licences pages). A licence that verifies but cannot be stored is reported on the licences page.

The delegates take their roles as `required property` declarations. `pragma ComponentBehavior: Bound` is not used: it needs Qt 6.5, and the host's Qt is 6.4 (the device has 6.8).

## Backend object API

The UI imports `Shipwright.Reef 1.0` and uses a singleton named `Reef`. The CXX-Qt bridge (`reef/client/app/src/bridge.rs`) implements it over `reef-backend`, and the bridge also does the network fetches, since the backend crate has no HTTP stack. This is the contract between the two sides.

### Properties

| Property | Type | Meaning / backend source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `installedRelease` | string | `release::detect()`, for example `5.2.0.17` |
| `arch` | string | `release::native_arch()` |
| `repoAlias` | string | `RepoConfig::alias` (`shipwright-reef`) |
| `repoState` | string | `pinned`, `missing`, `disabled` or `drifted` (`RepoConfig::pin_state` over `ssu lr`) |
| `registeredRepoUrl` | string | URL currently registered with ssu, or empty |
| `busy` | bool | a refresh or package transaction is running |
| `busyPackage` | string | RPM name the running transaction is for, or empty |
| `busyText` | string | a key for the running step (`checking`, `refreshing`, `repairing`, `downloading`, `installing` …); `Texts.busyText()` translates it |
| `progress` | int | 0 to 100, or -1 when unknown (PackageKit's 101) |
| `lastError` | string | last refresh or operation error, or empty; lines starting with U+001E are keyed messages for `Texts.message()` |
| `updateCount` | int | `store::Store::updates()` count (Reef packages only) |
| `revision` | int | changes on every model rebuild; bind `pkg: Reef.revision, Reef.packageDetails(name)` so details follow refreshes and licence changes |
| `catalogueModel` | model | visible packages (`catalogue.visible` joined by `store::entries`) that match `searchText` |
| `installedModel` | model | same roles, only rows whose `installState` is not `not_installed` |
| `featuredModel` | model | same roles, the catalogue's `featured` names that are visible, in its order |
| `licenceModel` | model | stored licences (`LicenceStore::list`) |
| `searchText` | string, rw | the catalogue page's search box; every whitespace-separated word must appear in a row's title, summary, category, publisher or RPM name (case-insensitive) for the row to stay in `catalogueModel` |
| `refreshOnStart` | bool, rw | setting |
| `backgroundCheckDays` | int, rw | 0 (never), 1 or 7; setting, read by `shipwright-reef --check-updates` (a daily systemd user timer, see `../app/README.md`) |
| `licenceServer` | string, rw | licence service base URL; setting |

`catalogueModel`, `installedModel` and `featuredModel` roles: `name` (RPM name), `title`, `summary`, `category`, `version` (catalogue build), `installState` (`not_installed`, `installed` or `update_available`), `installedVersion`, `licenceModel` (`free`, `one_off` or `subscription`), `licensed` (bool: a valid stored licence for the package's `app_id`), `publisher`, `iconPath` (the cached icon's local path, or empty), `featured` (bool) and `isNew` (bool: `added` within the last 30 days).

`licenceModel` roles: `appId`, `title` (from the catalogue, falling back to `appId`), `plan`, `status` (`active`, `grace`, `expired`, `revoked` or `invalid`), `expiresText` (localised date, or empty), `licenceId`.

### Invokables

| Call | Returns | Backend |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `refresh()` | void | fetch `RepoConfig::catalogue_url(release, arch)`, `Catalogue::parse`, `ssu lr` then `pin_state`, `Store::installed` and `Store::updates`; also refreshes subscriptions that need it and the revocation list |
| `packageDetails(name)` | object | `{name, title, summary, description, category, version, installState, installedVersion, updateVersion, testedOn: [string], permissions: [string], sandboxed, licenceModel, licensed, purchaseUrl, spdx, sizeText, homepage, source, keelTier, publisher, iconPath, screenshotPaths: [string], added}`. `sizeText` is pre-formatted because Keel v1 has no `Format`. `keelTier` is the catalogue's `keel_tier` (`A`, `B`, `none`, `not-applicable`) or empty. `screenshotPaths` holds only the screenshots already cached; `added` is `YYYY-MM-DD` or empty; `updateVersion` is the version PackageKit would update to (empty unless `installState` is `update_available`), which a cached catalogue can lag behind |
| `install(name)` | void | `Store::install`, with progress into `progress`/`busyText` |
| `update(name)` | void | `Store::update`: that package's Reef update only |
| `updateAll()` | void | `Store::update_all` |
| `remove(name)` | void | `Store::remove` |
| `repairRepository()` | void | runs `RepoConfig::repair_commands(state)` (directly, or through the helper if Phase 0 requires one) |
| `repairCommands()` | [string] | the same commands, as `Command::to_shell()` lines, for display |
| `checkLicenceToken(token)` | string | `""` if `Licence::verify_any_app` accepts the token, otherwise the error text |
| `licenceTokenApp(token)` | string | catalogue title (or app id) of a valid token |
| `addLicenceToken(token)` | string | `LicenceStore::save`; `""` or error text |
| `refreshLicences()` | void | `GET {licenceServer}/v1/claims/{code}` for each pending claim code (see "Buying"), then `GET {licenceServer}/v1/licences/{lid}/token` for each licence where `needs_refresh` is true, then `GET /v1/revocations` into `accept_revocations` |
| `removeLicence(appId)` | void | `LicenceStore::remove` |
| `buyUrl(name)` | string | the package's purchase URL with `claim=<code>` added (`claim_codes::purchase_url_with_claim`), after recording a new code as pending (`PendingClaims::create`); `""` for a free or unknown package, or with `lastError` set when the code cannot be recorded |
| `checkPurchases()` | void | `refreshLicences()` if a claim code is pending, at most every 10 seconds; after the running job when busy. The window calls it on becoming active |

### Buying

A paid app is bought on the web, so the licence has to come back to the phone by itself. Buy calls `buyUrl(name)`, which makes a claim code (128 bits from the OS random source, 32 lowercase hex characters), records it as pending in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/shipwright-reef/claims/<code>` (`{"app_id", "created_at"}`, mode 600, directory 700; at most 20, none older than 30 days), and gives the purchase URL with `claim=<code>` in its query; the page opens that URL and says the licence will follow. The checkout passes the code to the licence service with the order. Every licence refresh (at start with `refreshOnStart`, `refreshLicences()` on the licences page, and `checkPurchases()` when the user comes back from the browser) asks `GET {licenceServer}/v1/claims/{code}` for each pending code: a token (`{"token": …}`) is verified and stored like a pasted one and the code forgotten; 404 (not paid yet) keeps it; 410 (refunded or revoked) and 400 forget it; other failures keep it and are reported in `lastError`, with the code left out. Paid apps then get the token through the hand-off (`reef/licence/README.md`). Pasting a token stays as the fallback.

### Signals

- `operationFinished(string name, bool ok, string message)`: after install, update, remove or repair. `name` is the RPM name, or empty for update-all and repair. A failure also sets `lastError`.

Property change signals follow the usual `<property>Changed` convention.

## Checking

The app's smoke test (`../app/tests/smoke-test.sh`) loads every page and the cover against a Keel build and the real `Reef` object, and fails on any QML warning. Syntax and lint:

```
cd reef/client/ui/qml
for f in $(find . -name '*.qml'); do /usr/lib/qt6/bin/qmlformat "$f" >/dev/null || echo "$f"; done
/usr/lib/qt6/bin/qmllint -I <keel build>/qml $(find . -name '*.qml')
```

qmllint reports `Shipwright.Reef` as unresolved (the CXX-Qt module is generated at build time) and `pageStack` as unqualified (ApplicationWindow's context property).

## Needs device verification

1. **Launch mode.** `../app/packaging/shipwright-reef.desktop` starts the app through keel-shell (`Exec=/usr/bin/keel-shell -- /usr/bin/shipwright-reef`). Sandboxing is disabled, as in `sailfishos-chum-gui.desktop`. Check that the app starts from the app grid, and that `/usr/share/mapplauncherd/privileges.d/shipwright-reef` puts the process in the `privileged` group: run `grep Groups /proc/$(pgrep shipwright-reef)/status` and compare with the gid of `privileged`.
2. **Cover action.** Check that the refresh `CoverAction` fires through keel-shell's cover window (Phase 0 probe 3).
3. **Pulley menus, remorse and dialogs under keel-shell.** qt-runner cannot show dialogs or second windows (docs/plan.md, Constraints 3). `AddLicenceDialog` is a page-stack Dialog in the same window, not a new window. Check that it opens and that the virtual keyboard types into its `TextField` (Phase 0 probe 2).
4. **Opening URLs.** Check that "Buy" and "Homepage" (`Qt.openUrlExternally`) open the Sailfish Browser from a Qt6 app running under keel-shell, that the checkout URL carries `claim=`, and that switching back to Reef after paying (`applicationActive`) adds the licence.
5. **Context menu and remorse.** Long-press a licence: the Forget menu opens under the row, and the remorse timer removes it.
