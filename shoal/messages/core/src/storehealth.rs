//! Rows the stores can no longer decode. One of them fails every sync the same
//! way, so the sync is stopped until it is gone - the store is worth more than
//! the row. Nothing is deleted outright: every row is copied into
//! `store/quarantine.sqlite3` first - every column of it, so it is a row that
//! could be written back, not two fields - because "unreadable here" and
//! "worthless" are the same thing only until the next SDK version.
//!
//! What that copy is and is not: the bytes are exactly the store's own, so they
//! are encrypted where the store is and plain where a legacy store is plain.
//! Nothing in this app reads the file back - putting a row back needs a tool
//! with the store key and a decoder that handles it. The file goes with the
//! store on sign-out and survives `rebuild_store`.
