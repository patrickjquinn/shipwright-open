"""The two desktop files must grant the same thing.

The link handler and the app carry their own `Permissions=` line, and the file
says in a comment that they are the same list — which they were not: one entry
was missing for two releases. A comment is not a mechanism, so this is one.

Sailjail drops a permission it does not know without a word, and whichever
file started the process decides what it may do. The one that is short is
therefore a second, weaker profile for the same application, and nothing at
runtime says so.
