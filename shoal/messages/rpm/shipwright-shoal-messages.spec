%description
Shoal Messages is Shipwright's messenger for Sailfish OS, a native Matrix
client with a Silica interface. It is a fork of xmatic by JimKnopfIoT
(Apache-2.0); see NOTICE. The protocol
core is built on matrix-rust-sdk, so sliding sync and end-to-end encryption
including cross-signing, device verification and key backup work the same way
they do in modern clients. Voice calls run over WebRTC via GStreamer. The
Rust core is linked in statically and is built ahead of packaging by
scripts/build-core.sh.

%changelog
* Thu Oct 08 2026 Shipwright - 0.1.0-8
- Opens on Sailfish OS 5.2 instead of "Encryption not possible". The database
  key now lives in the app's own private storage, which no other app can read.
  A key from an earlier version is moved there from Sailfish Secrets while it
  can still be read.
- Pushes after a restart are decrypted without opening the app first.

* Thu Oct 08 2026 Shipwright - 0.1.0-7
- Plainer wording. Diagnostics list only what was measured.

* Thu Oct 08 2026 Shipwright - 0.1.0-6
- Keel Actions (ADR-0018) for Pilot: find a conversation, read its latest
  messages, send a text message (Pilot asks first). The room page tells
  Pilot which conversation is open and its last messages, so "reply to
  this" works. Installs actions.json and the D-Bus interface file.

* Mon Oct 05 2026 Shipwright - 0.1.0-5
- One primary sign-in button; the alternatives are demoted.

* Sat Oct 03 2026 Shipwright - 0.1.0-4
- Launcher icon redone in the Sailfish OS icon system (icons/make-icons.py).

* Sat Oct 03 2026 Shipwright 0.1.0-3
- No empty debuginfo or debugsource packages: %%install strips the binary.
- xmatic 0.38.0-1's changelog date: 24 September 2026 is a Thursday.

* Sat Oct 03 2026 Shipwright 0.1.0-2
- Require sailfishsecretsdaemon-secretsplugin-common by name: as a file
  path outside /usr/bin, zypper could not resolve it on a phone without it,
  and the install failed.

* Wed Sep 30 2026 Shipwright 0.1.0-1
- First Shoal Messages build: hard fork of xmatic 0.41.0 (commit 40ce16b),
  rebranded (package, binary, desktop, D-Bus names, data paths, icons).
- Push defaults to the Shoal Push distributor when it is running, and to
  the Shipwright Matrix push gateway; any other distributor and gateway can
  still be chosen. See CHANGES-FROM-UPSTREAM.md.
- Entries below are upstream xmatic history, kept as released.

* Wed Sep 30 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.41.0-1
- Built on matrix-rust-sdk 0.19. The local data is converted on the first
  start and cannot be read by 0.40 or older afterwards: going back needs a
  backup of the app's data taken before updating. From this version on, a
  session file written by a later version is named as such instead of
  asking for a key.
- Starting without a network no longer shows the sign-in page over a valid
  session. The app opens as usual; where the server has to be asked first it
  says "No connection" and keeps trying. Signing in again there would have
  started a new device.
- A connection that drops while the session is renewed no longer signs you
  out, and the security page no longer asks for the recovery key when the
  server merely could not be asked.
- Something the server refuses - a message, an edit, a deletion, a reaction -
  no longer silently holds up everything sent after it in that room. The room
  shows what is stuck and why, with "Send again" and "Discard". A refused
  deletion is marked as not sent instead of looking done.
- Search: a hit further back than the loaded history opens the conversation
  around it, with "Back to the latest messages" to return. Results no longer
  stop early, and polls are found.
- A live location share whose start got no answer within two minutes is
  stopped, and the room says so.
- Drafts sent as a text file, photos from the camera cell and decoded voice
  messages no longer stay behind after a failed send or a crash, and go with
  "Delete downloaded media".
- With "Load pictures" off, the picture in a quote is not fetched either.
- A JPEG or PNG photo whose smaller copy would not be smaller no longer goes
  out with its EXIF or XMP data (the place it was taken): the copy goes
  instead. Sending at original resolution still sends the file as it is.
- Known limit of this SDK version: a room joined while the app runs can show
  its history as complete too early, and older messages there cannot be
  loaded. The earlier workaround has no safe equivalent in matrix-rust-sdk
  0.19; another client shows the older history meanwhile.
- A poll that has not ended and hides its results no longer shows how many
  votes it has.
- A location the sender shares of themselves shows their picture on the
  map instead of a plain dot.
- Updated network libraries (TLS and HTTP/2 fixes).

* Tue Sep 29 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.40.0-1
- The attachment picker's first cell opens the camera: flash (auto, on,
  off), a thirds grid, tap to focus, pinch to zoom. The photo goes straight
  to sending; keep it in the gallery if you like, otherwise it is deleted
  once sent or when the send is called off. The cell can show the live
  picture, under Privacy; off by default, since the camera would then run
  whenever the picker is open.
- Tapping a location's map shows that map again under the address, filling
  the page and zoomable with two fingers or a double tap until street names
  are large. Nothing more is fetched for it.
- Stopping a live location share, or switching sharing off, while it is
  still starting now ends it; before, it could keep running. The first live
  position goes out at once, and stopping right after starting no longer
  fails.
- Opening a link asks with a plain Cancel instead of "Keep". Under a map the
  question is gone, and in landscape the address takes one small line.

* Mon Sep 28 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.39.0-1
- Locations. A room's pull-down menu sends your position once, or shares it
  live for an hour, six hours or a day. Received locations show their
  coordinates; a map from OpenStreetMap is shown where you allow it. Both are
  off by default, under Account, Privacy.
- Adding an answer to a new poll no longer clears the answers already typed.

* Mon Sep 28 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.38.2-1
- A homeserver without a TURN relay no longer puts "no relay available:
  deserialization failed" on the account page. That answer is read as "no
  relay configured"; calls then go without one, as before.

* Sun Sep 27 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.38.1-1
- "Send direct message" opens the existing chat with that person instead of
  creating a new room each time. Tapped again before the sync had caught up,
  it used to start another one.

* Thu Sep 24 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.38.0-1
- The chat list shows the last message in each room, under the name, with the
  time of it beside the name. A picture, a voice message or a poll is named by
  what it is; a message still waiting for its key says so.
- The initial of a room's space is no longer drawn over its picture unless it
  is switched on under Account, Appearance. It was wanted by some and not by
  others; whoever had it on keeps it.
- A long message is no longer turned into a text file by itself. It goes out as
  a message and arrives folded to three lines with "Show more"; sending it as a
  .txt is an offer now - a long press on the attachment clip, or an entry in
  the attachment picker.
- Forwarding an attachment sends the file instead of its name. A forwarded
  video used to arrive as a text message reading "clip.mp4"; audio and
  documents went the same way. The video page can forward as well.

* Tue Sep 22 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.37.0-1
- A room opens again where you were reading it: leave it in the middle of its
  history and it comes back to that place, for as long as the app runs. It
  follows the same switch as opening at the oldest unread message.

* Tue Sep 22 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.36.2-1
- A message longer than a screen is folded to three lines, with "Show more".
- A message taller than the screen opens its actions as a page: the menu went
  black there.
- A draft longer than three screens goes out as a text file.

* Tue Sep 22 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.36.1-1
- "Save" on the video page works: its pull-down had nothing to hang from.
- Saving an attachment says where it went, or that it could not be saved.

* Mon Sep 21 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.36.0-1
- A room's name, topic and picture can be changed: "Edit room" in the room
  info's pull-down, offered where the power levels allow it.
- A bridged room says what a change does there: a group passes it on to the
  other network after asking; a bridged direct chat says the bridge owns the
  name.

* Sun Sep 20 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.35.0-1
- The chat list marks which space a room belongs to: the space's initial over
  the room's picture, in that space's own colour.
- The colour is derived from the space and can be chosen instead - hold a space
  in the space list and pick "Colour".
- "Mark the space on the picture" in Appearance switches the whole marker off.

* Thu Sep 17 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.34.1-1
- An invitation no longer shows the conversation opened before it.
- An invitation opened from a notification says it is one, and can be accepted.

* Wed Sep 16 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.34.0-1
- Video between two xmatic devices: port 0 under BUNDLE is not a refusal.
- Call after a video call answerable again.
- Jump to the read marker: waits while rows arrive, no longer marks read on failure.
- Mute button and download size in the video player.

* Mon Sep 14 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.33.2-1
- One stored entry that cannot be read any more no longer stops the app from
  syncing. It used to fail every attempt the same way while the app treated it
  as a lost network and retried for as long as it ran: the room list stopped
  part way and the banner flickered. Such entries are now dropped - the rooms
  and messages behind them come back from the homeserver - and where that is
  not possible, the list says so instead of waiting forever.
- A picture whose homeserver offers no preview is fetched in full instead of
  staying blank. Servers with preview generation switched off refused every
  preview, and the app took that for "no picture".

* Sun Sep 13 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.33.0-1
- A system line in a room - who joined, who was invited, who was removed -
  carries the picture of whoever acted and the time it happened. The picture
  opens that person's profile, the same as on a message.
- A room link tapped in another app opens in xmatic. Only matrix: links and
  matrix.to addresses are accepted; a room the account is not in asks first.

* Fri Sep 11 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.32.1-1
- Local data that cannot be read back no longer ends the session. A page of
  its own says so and offers to rebuild rooms and messages from the homeserver,
  keeping this device and its keys; a sign-in over it would have cost both.
- The Matrix library's own warnings and errors reach the system journal,
  scrubbed of identifiers, and its errors the error log.

* Fri Sep 11 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.32.0-1
- A voice message can be converted to text on request: a long press offers it
  where Privacy allows it, off by default. It needs an offline speech-to-text
  program from OpenRepos with a model that recognises the language by itself;
  the privacy page names both, with their sizes, and a check button tests the
  whole path. The recording is decoded inside the app's sandbox and only a
  plain WAV reaches the other program; the text is shown as plain text, marked
  as recognised automatically, and kept in memory only.
- A voice message can be recorded hands-free: a tap on the microphone starts
  it, a second tap sends it, and seven seconds of silence after speech send it
  by themselves. Silence alone drops it, and so does leaving the room or the
  app; a cancel button stands next to the running time. Holding to record and
  releasing to send stays as it was.
- A ban, a removal or an invitation names both people, and a ban or removal
  its reason. The line used to fall back to the sender where the event carried
  no name, which named the moderator as the one banned.

* Tue Sep 08 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.31.0-1
- A help page measures why the secure storage hands out no key and gives the
  advice that fits the answer. Where the storage service itself is locked, that
  is a new device lock code and a restart, not an installation.
- The locked and "encryption not possible" screens lead there, and say that
  signing out deletes this device's keys without repairing anything.

* Mon Sep 07 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.30.1-1
- Sign-in works against homeservers that refuse a redirect address carrying a
  port. The port belongs to the moment of signing in, not to the registration,
  and declaring it made some servers reject the app before the browser opened.
- Animated pictures are marked as such in the conversation and play in the
  full-screen view when the play mark is tapped. Nothing moves on its own.
- In a two-party chat, the other person's message can be deleted where the
  room allows it — for a voice message both sides are done with.
- Coming back from a picture, a member's page or any other page keeps the place
  in the conversation. It used to land on the same older message every time.

* Sun Sep 06 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.30.0-1
- Mentions. Typing "@" opens a row of the room's members over the message
  line; tapping one puts the name in the text. The message then carries the
  mention itself, so the other side is notified whatever its client reads.
- A member's page has "Mention" beside the other actions: it takes you back
  to the room with the name already in the message line.
- Where your power level allows it, "@room" stands at the front of the row.

* Sat Sep 05 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.29.0-1
- Polls. A poll from any client is shown as its question with a bar under
  each answer; tap a line to vote, tap it again to take the vote back. "New
  poll" in the room's pull-down creates one, with a choice of several answers
  and of hiding the results until the poll ends. The creator can end it.
- A hidden poll that is still running shows no numbers - and none reach the
  page that could show them. What a poll cannot be is said where it is made:
  who voted for what stays readable in the room, in every client.
- The chat list and notifications name a poll by its question.
- Link previews, off by default. Under Privacy they can be allowed never, only
  in unencrypted rooms, or always. Your homeserver fetches the page and the
  message shows its host, title and description under the text; the setting
  says what the server learns from that.

* Fri Sep 04 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.28.3-1
- Messages can be formatted. Hold a word in the message field to mark it, then
  bold, italic, struck through, underlined or monospace from the row above.
  Markers typed by hand work the same way, and what goes out carries the
  formatting other clients read.
- Struck-through and monospace text from other clients is drawn as such. It
  never was: the platform's text renderer has no tag for either.
- New switch under Appearance: the return key sends the message. Off it makes
  a line break, as before, and only the arrow sends. Where it sends, holding
  the send arrow makes the line break instead.
- The keyboard stays up after sending where the setting says so. It never did:
  the send arrow is a press outside the message field, and that clears its
  focus on its own.
- One picker for an attachment, with two tabs: the gallery, divided by the
  folders that exist, and the file system from the home folder down. Both
  select several files at once, and they can be mixed.
- Pictures are made smaller before they go out and lose their metadata with
  them, the place a photograph was taken included. A screenshot keeps every
  pixel. "Send at original resolution" on the send page keeps a single picture
  as it lies; a forwarded one is never re-encoded.
- The text field in the emoji picker says what it does: your text becomes the
  reaction. It was read as a search field, which it is not.
- A message's actions are ordered by how often they are wanted: what deletes at
  the top, what answers at the bottom.
- The conversation no longer jumps while the keyboard opens.
- Switching rooms no longer leaves a red error on the account page.

* Wed Sep 02 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.28.2-1
- The paper clip sits right of the message field now, the emoji face left.
- The emoji page says what to do, which state it is in, and how many
  pictures are ready; the buttons and the switch name the emoji pack.
- An emoji pack is read in by tapping its folder; the browser opens at the
  home folder and Downloads is no longer the only place a pack may lie.
- On a device with a landscape screen the attachment and avatar pickers come
  up in the device's orientation and no longer stall.

* Wed Sep 02 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.28.1-1
- A message's menu is a context menu again; landscape keeps the actions page.
- Reactions work again, as do "Reply in thread" and forwarding an attachment.
- The room's pull-down cannot be lost any more.
- No "continue without encryption": the store is encrypted or not created.
- A store that is marked encrypted is no longer opened without its key.
- Cached media is named by a hash, so preview and original cannot collide.
- The old media cache is cleared once on the first download after the update.
- Signing out removes the push registration from the homeserver as well.
- A push gateway has to be an https address.
- The push registration is stored readable only by this app.
- A notification the push rules call quiet no longer makes a sound.
- The recovery key is taken back out of the clipboard.
- Everything this app writes is created readable only by itself.
- A room that cannot be opened says so instead of spinning for ever.
- A lost answer no longer leaves the search, the index or a room stuck.
- Leaving one room while opening another cannot close the new one.
- The pinned view's diffs can no longer land in the live conversation.
- A push no longer starts a second encryption sync beside the running one.
- Downloads run four at a time instead of one per row on screen.
- A profile picture is bounded before it is fetched, not only after.
- A member without devices is asked for once per session, not per room.
- The sign-in page and the storage page no longer wait on unrelated work.
- "People you have a direct chat with" now means exactly that.
- A diff the model cannot apply is reported instead of dropped in silence.
- A failing command answers instead of taking its reply down with it.
- A dying call pipeline ends the call instead of leaving it "connecting".
- A large member list no longer arrives as one block on the drawing thread.
- Dragging a colour slider no longer writes the settings file per frame.
- The app stops rather than writing its data beside itself.
- A web link shows where it leads before it is opened.
- A link with two query parameters opens the address it displays.
- A sender's name no longer carries from one room into another.
- Pictures can be set to load on a tap instead of by themselves.
- The member profile's actions cannot collapse to nothing.
- The third-party notices list every crate that is linked, not two thirds.
- Pictures have a frame in the grey opposite the background they stand on.
- The frame keeps a margin to the picture, and other people's pictures get one.
- A reply to a picture no longer draws the quote outside the message.
- Someone else's message no longer takes the width the avatar stands in.
- The member page's actions are laid out in one order, with the details.
- Withdrawing a verification is offered while the identity still holds.
- Own and older messages appear again in a room that was already open.
- The push page lists the distributors it found instead of none.

* Tue Sep 01 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.28.0-1
- Rooms stopped receiving on accounts with many rooms. 0.27.0 widened the sync
  window per room so the unread badge could count, and that number is
  multiplied by the rooms in one request - which the room list grows to a
  hundred at a time. On an account with two hundred rooms the request asked for
  forty thousand events, timed out, and everything but the twenty most recent
  rooms stopped updating, silently and for good. The window is back where it
  was, and the badge now says where it stopped looking: it counts to twenty and
  shows "20+" beyond, in the list and on the cover.
- The emoji comparison had no buttons. Verifying could not be finished from
  that page at all in 0.26.2 and 0.27.0 - neither a device of one's own nor
  another person - because the two answers were laid out in a way that gave
  them a width of zero. They are back.
- Verifying another person moved out of the encryption page, where it sat as a
  Matrix address to type in directly under the button that verifies one's own
  second device. In a two-party encrypted chat the room's own menu now offers
  it without asking for an address; for everybody else there is one entry in
  the chat list's pull-down.
- The security page that comes up after signing in no longer stays on screen
  once everything is green. Entering the recovery key settles it from the page
  above, and coming back landed on the alarm that had just been cleared.
- A failed request stopped claiming there is no key backup. Asking the server
  is a question over the network, and while a sync fault made the app believe
  it was offline, the answer "could not ask" was read as "there is none" - so
  the security page raised an alarm about a backup that was on the server all
  along. It says the server could not be asked, and asks again once the
  connection is back.
- The cover says when nothing is arriving. Being cut off was written under the
  room's name and in the chat list, but not on the tile - and this app has no
  background service, so the tile is how it is watched.
- Account has an error log now, at the top of its pull-down menu. Whatever
  fails is kept there for the run, newest first, instead of flashing as a red
  line on one page and being overwritten by the next failure. Identifiers are
  already stripped by the core, so the list can be copied and passed on as it
  stands. Nothing is written to disk.
- "Token is not active" no longer appears as an error. The sign-in token is
  rotated in the background, and a download that was in flight across the
  rotation came back with that message - which reads as an ended session while
  the session is perfectly alive. It goes to the log; a session that really has
  ended still signs out and says so.
- Everything a message can be done to is on a page now instead of a context
  menu. That menu shares its machinery with the room's pull-down: opened on a
  message near the top of the view it took the pull-down's place, and with that
  on screen there was no way to leave the room, call, search it or open its
  page at all.
- Forwarding works on attachments. A picture could only be forwarded from the
  full-screen view, and every other attachment offered "Forward" and then sent
  the file name as a sentence.
- Push notifications, asked for by users and off by default. They have their
  own setting and do nothing until switched on by hand: Account › Push
  notifications. A UnifiedPush distributor has to be installed separately - it
  is the app that holds the connection, this client still has no background
  service of its own - and a push gateway has to be chosen, because a
  homeserver cannot talk to a distributor directly and nobody can guess whose
  gateway you trust. Notifications carry no message text; the message is
  fetched and decrypted on the device. What it does disclose, and to whom, is
  written out in docs/PUSH.md - read that before turning it on. Leaving it off
  changes nothing.
- A picture in a reply quote is shown whole and in a frame of its own. It was
  cropped to a square out of the middle, which is where a photograph says the
  least, and it lay against the reply's text with no edge to separate it.

* Mon Aug 31 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.27.0-1
- Messages can be searched, one conversation at a time, from the room's
  pull-down menu. The index lives on the device and is encrypted with the same
  key as the rest of the local storage; the query never leaves the phone. There
  is no server-side search and no fallback to one - a homeserver cannot read an
  encrypted room, so it could only ever search the rooms this app does not
  have. Opening the search page hands it whatever history is already on the
  device, so a room that has been scrolled back is searchable to that point.
  What it cannot do is written on the page itself: whole words only, so "test"
  does not find "test9", and only plain text - captions, file names and
  anything a bot sends are not in it.
- The line marking where reading stopped is drawn for everybody now. It existed
  before but hung off a setting about *other* people's read status, which is
  off by default, so almost nobody ever saw it. It is independent of that
  setting, and it holds still while the room is read instead of sliding to the
  newest message. Where the room opens is a setting of its own (Display, on by
  default): at the last read message, or at the newest one with the line found
  by scrolling up.
- A message whose authenticity could not be confirmed carries a mark instead of
  a sentence. A line of text under every affected message said the same thing
  twenty times over; a red triangle or an orange dot says it once, in the line
  that already holds the time. Nothing is hidden - every affected message keeps
  its mark, because leaving it off the ones below the first would claim they
  are fine. Tapping a mark shows what it means for that message, and leads to a
  page listing all six cases.
- The unread count was wrong after every start. Messages that arrived while the
  app was closed were counted as one, however many there were, while the
  notification for the same room named the right number. The counters are
  computed on the device from the messages a sync has actually carried, and a
  sync carried exactly one per room. It carries what is needed now.
- A room opened from a notification, from a direct chat or by following an
  upgrade shows its name in the header. Only the chat list passed one, so those
  three arrived with an identifier and left the header empty.
- The chat list says how many rooms the server counts next to the number it
  holds, so "20 of 412" tells a missing room apart from a list that has not
  finished growing.
* Sat Aug 29 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.26.2-1
- The page that says what is not yet in order was itself not in order. Its
  frame ran along the very top edge of the display and so passed under a camera
  cutout, and it stopped where the text stopped instead of reaching the bottom
  of the screen - a third of the display below it, empty, which reads as a
  broken layout. Both fixed.
- It also asked for a recovery key from accounts that have none. "Not set up"
  and "not unlocked on this device" are different situations and want opposite
  advice; the page now says which of the two it is, and offers to set a backup
  up rather than pointing at a key that cannot exist.
- The encryption page did the same in its own way: "Unlock backup" stood there
  whatever the account looked like, and an attempt then came back with the
  library's own words about account data. That section is only shown where
  there is something to unlock.
* Sat Aug 29 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.26.1-1
- A picture with a caption could go missing. Sending one while an earlier
  message was still on its way, on a slow connection, ended with the send button
  pressed and nothing happening at all - the picture and the text under it were
  gone. The attachment page does not send by itself; it hands the job back to
  the conversation and closes, and the conversation was putting a question on
  screen while that page was still closing, which the system drops without a
  word. The attachment now waits until the screen is still, and is never let go
  of on the way.
- Button labels no longer run off the page or come back cut in the middle of a
  word. Buttons here were a single line that grew with the text, which is fine
  in English and not in languages that build longer words - reported in
  Norwegian and in Russian. A label too long for one line now uses two, in the
  same size and the same shape as before. This changes no wording in any
  language; it only stops the words being cut.
* Sat Aug 29 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.26.0-1
- A device that cannot encrypt its local storage says so before it stores
  anything. Until now the app asked the system for a key, and where none came
  back it created an unencrypted database and wrote one line into the journal -
  which is not a place anybody looks. That was not a rare fault: a
  factory-fresh phone showed it, because its system image carries only the
  client library of the key service and not the service itself. The first
  start on such a device now creates nothing at all. It names what is missing,
  gives the commands to install it, and gives a command to check the result
  with, because a user should not have to take our word for it. The package is
  also declared as a dependency, so on most devices it is simply installed
  along with the app and none of this is ever seen.
- Whoever really cannot install it can still say "continue without" - once,
  deliberately, with what it costs written out. Devices that already hold data
  are never locked out: they keep working and are led, not blocked.
- The state of this device is now four coloured lines instead of a sentence
  somebody has to go looking for: backup, recovery, cross-signing and local
  storage. Green is in order, orange is a fault you can clear, red is missing.
  The same four lines appear on the encryption page and on a page that comes up
  once after starting when something is not green - with the action that fits
  what is actually wrong, and "later" always available. When everything is
  green nothing appears at all, and the indicator in the header is gone too.
- Signing out to encrypt an old database leaves the device unverified and the
  backup locked until the recovery key is entered again. The dialog warned
  about that beforehand; nothing led there afterwards. Now something does.
- Pinned messages appear on first entering a room. They were read from the
  room's own state on opening, and from the server after pinning something -
  two paths that had drifted apart. On a database that was just created the
  state does not carry them yet, so the first visit showed nothing and the
  second one showed everything, which read as pins that keep falling out. Both
  paths now ask the same way.
* Fri Aug 28 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.25.2-1
- Pictures show themselves again. 0.25.0 asked an attachment to declare its
  size before a preview was drawn for it, and one that declared none stayed a
  line with a small mark that had to be tapped. The app's own pictures declared
  nothing at all: the library writes an empty description when it is handed
  none, so everything sent from here travelled without size, width or height -
  to every client, not only to this one. Both halves are fixed: the preview no
  longer asks for a figure the sender is free to omit, and a picture sent from
  here now carries its size and its measurements. The ceiling that protects the
  decoder is unchanged; it weighs what actually arrived, which is the half that
  never depended on the sender.
* Fri Aug 28 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.25.1-1
- The room's name strip keeps out from under a camera cutout. On a phone with a
  wide one the notch cut through the room name at the height of a lower-case
  letter, and the padlock in front of it was halved. Every other page in the app
  uses Silica's own header, which has kept that margin all along; this strip is
  the room's own and did not inherit it. It now follows the same rule, and on a
  phone without a cutout the margin is zero.
* Thu Aug 27 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.25.0-1
- The padlock at the top of a room carries no colour any more. Red and green
  over the room's name shouted louder than everything else in the strip; the
  shape says it instead - closed, or open with its body struck through - drawn
  in the theme's ink at a third of its strength and with the same hairline as
  the face beside the message field.
- The read mark stood on the wrong message. It was kept per row number, and a
  page of older messages arriving at the top shifts every row under it: the eye
  then sat on the neighbour's message, and it appeared and vanished as the
  conversation went on. It is kept per message now, recounted after the current
  model signal rather than inside it, and it never falls - a receipt is taken
  off its old row before it is put on the new one, and for that moment nobody
  had read anything.
- "Show in conversation" works from the room's info page too. It asked the page
  directly underneath to jump, which is the conversation only when the pinned
  list was opened from the banner; opened from the info page nothing happened at
  all and the room stood at its end.
- Who set a reaction: hold it down. The names appear under the message, where
  the readers appear, with the reaction in front of them. A tap still adds or
  takes back one's own.
- Deleting a message takes a countdown, like leaving a room - it was one tap at
  the bottom of a menu, and it cannot be undone.
- The read mark can be reached. It sits on the bottom line of a bubble and its
  tap area reaches below that, which is where the message field begins: on the
  last message it could not be hit, and the names it unfolds appeared behind the
  field. The conversation now keeps that much air under its last row.
- A list of names no longer runs down a column three characters wide. It widens
  the bubble to the left instead, up to the width every other text in it obeys -
  and the message, its reactions and its time stay where they were while it
  does.
- The conversation no longer jumps to its end under a moving finger. Reaching
  the top asks for older messages, they arrive as rows, and the row count is
  what tells the view to follow the newest - so the swipe that fetched them
  threw the view to the bottom.
* Thu Aug 27 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.24.1-1
- Whether a room is encrypted is a padlock at the top, in front of its name:
  closed and green, or open and red with its body struck through. It says what
  the line under the name used to spell out and what the mark behind the message
  field was too faint to say.
- The sender's picture in a conversation is as large as a room's picture in the
  chat list. It was half that, and the two are looked at one after the other.
- A reaction is drawn half again as large. On a small screen one emoji at the
  old size could not be told from another.
- The keyboard goes away once a message is sent, and the conversation is back in
  full height. "Hide the keyboard after sending" under Appearance keeps it up
  for whoever writes several in a row.
- Text typed and not sent survives the way back to the chat list and a trip
  through another room. It is kept for as long as the app runs and never written
  to disk.
- "Show in conversation" from the pinned messages goes to the pinned message
  instead of showing it for a blink and then dropping to the end of the room.
  The jump was resolved against the pinned view of the timeline, which the way
  back replaced a moment later.
- A thread opens at its newest post and stays there. Counting rows was not
  enough: a row is laid out before its text has wrapped, and the header settles
  later still.
- The conversation keeps its place when the keyboard opens. The list loses
  height at its bottom edge, and a Flickable holds its top - so the newest
  message slid out of sight behind the keyboard while the message field rose.
- A room is marked read while it is being read, not only when it is left, and
  its badge in the chat list goes with it. Two halves: the check asked a flag
  that a jump and the opening at the first unread message both switch off, and a
  receipt does not reliably come back as a room-list diff.
- The time of last activity in the chat list carries the year wherever it is not
  the current one. A conversation that stopped in 2025 read as if it had been
  this year.
* Wed Aug 26 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.24.0-1
- A thread's replies stay in the thread instead of standing in the room a
  second time. The way in is the marker on the root, and it no longer depends
  on what the local store happens to know: the room's thread roots are asked of
  the server as well, so threads that existed before this version are reachable
  too. Measured on two devices - on the one whose store predated threads, every
  thread was doorless without that question.
- The picture of your own camera during a video call is shown the way a mirror
  shows it. Only the preview: what the other side receives is untouched.
- Threads carry their replies. A thread opened from a message showed its root
  and nothing more: an own reply was gone again on the next visit, and a reply
  written in another client never arrived - while that same reply stood in the
  room's timeline, so nothing was lost on the way. The SDK keeps a thread's
  events only where threading is switched on, and it never was. Threads have
  therefore not worked since they were built. What it costs to switch on: a
  reply inside a thread no longer raises the room's badge by itself.
- A room with a lot unread opens where reading stopped. The row was looked for
  once, in the newest slice a room hands over first, and dropped without a word
  when it was not there - which is precisely the room with a lot unread. It is
  fetched now, and the last read message goes to the top of the screen, so the
  line and the first unread message are both in view.
- The fully-read marker is sent even with read receipts switched off. It is
  private account data: holding it back told nobody anything and only cost this
  device the line in the conversation and the place a room opens at.
- Who read a message is an eye and a number instead of the words "read by", and
  a tap on it unfolds the names - it took a long press before.
- The emoji offered first are the user's own: press and hold one in any other
  tab to keep it in the first, press and hold it there to take it out again. It
  stays where it was, and the first tab holds as many as fit.
- A recording of one's own goes out marked as a voice message (MSC3245) with
  its length instead of as a plain audio file. Other clients draw it as a voice
  message, and a bridge to another network can make a native voice note of it -
  one of them refused everything else as an unsupported format, which read as
  if the recording were broken.
- The message line says whether what is typed there will be encrypted: a
  padlock before the text, struck through where the room is not, faint enough
  to stay out of the way. Its three buttons are the same size and the same
  weight to look at now, and the line itself is longer.
- During a video call the microphone and the hang-up sit in the lower left
  corner as half-transparent symbols, out of the picture instead of across the
  middle of it.
- A room list longer than fifty rooms grows when it is scrolled to its end.
  Before, those fifty were all there were, with nothing saying so.
- A thread says as much about a message as the room does: the line naming what
  the sender's keys do not vouch for, and the warning before sending to
  somebody whose devices were never verified. Both were missing there.
- "Pin" and "Invite" are offered where the room allows them. A room that keeps
  either above the ordinary member turned them into a tap whose only possible
  outcome was the server's refusal.
- The account page says it when session and message database lie on the device
  unencrypted, and leads to where that can be changed. It was said only on the
  encryption page, which one has to go looking for.
- An attachment larger than this app will take is refused before it is
  downloaded, from the size the event declares, instead of after a hundred
  megabytes have been held in memory. What actually arrives is still weighed:
  the sender writes that figure.
- The emoji set's checksums are SHA-256 and its list is written whole or not at
  all. A set read in before this keeps working - the list says which digest it
  was taken with, and one that says nothing is read the old way. A list cut
  short by a crash used to read as no list at all, and the pictures were then
  drawn unchecked.
- The drawn marks - the padlock, the face, the eye - survive a trip through the
  tile view. They were painted into a framebuffer, and a window that leaves the
  screen hands its framebuffer back; what came back was empty.
- The store key is wiped where it is held, in a way the compiler may not
  optimise away, and the second copy that encoding it produces is wiped too.
- Signing out stops the watchers first. Two of them held a client of their own
  and kept running afterwards, which means they held the store open while it
  was being deleted.
- A session the server has thrown away is taken down instead of only reported:
  everything still talking to that server stops, and the stored session goes,
  so the next start shows the login page instead of a sync that can only fail.

* Wed Aug 26 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.23.0-1
- Privacy has a page of its own under Account: who may call you (everyone,
  people you have a direct chat with, or only a list you keep), whether group
  rooms may ring at all, whether video is answered as video, and a brake
  against repeated calls. A refused call rings nothing and tells the caller
  nothing.
- Downloaded pictures, videos and documents are deleted when you sign out.
  That is the new default; the other choices are never, on closing the app, or
  as soon as the app is not in front. The page says plainly that these files
  lie on the device as unencrypted as the ones in the gallery.
- The lists that name people are stored encrypted, like the session and the
  keys already were. An older unencrypted list is taken over once and removed.
- Read receipts work in both directions: your own messages say how many people
  read them, a long press names them, and sending them is a switch.
- A message with thousands of nested tags no longer takes the app down with
  it. It was not a crash that a restart cured - the event stayed in the room
  and took the app down again on every visit.
- A call can no longer be redirected by a third party in the room: the peer is
  fixed when the call is placed, not by whoever answers first.
- A picture can no longer cost more memory than the device has, whichever side
  it is long on, and answering without video now also stops the other side's
  video from being decoded.
- The session file is written whole or not at all.
- Error reports keep the server's own words - a rate limit is named as one -
  while addresses, hosts and identifiers are removed.
- Room link copy sits in the room's pull-down menu; sign out sits under
  Account, and only there.

* Tue Aug 25 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.22.2-1
- A reaction is picked from the whole emoji set: a page of its own, Unicode's
  groups in a row above it, the common handful first. Typing one by hand is
  unchanged, and a picture set that spells one name differently is found now.
- The same page writes into the message: a face next to the send button opens
  it, the emoji lands where the cursor is.
- The conversation stays at its end when a row grows after the fact - a
  reaction under the last message used to leave the end below the screen.
- Text typed before a picture was picked becomes its caption instead of a
  second message; calling the send off puts the text back.
- Names stop disappearing while a room's member list is being fetched: the
  last name and picture known for a sender stand in, and the list is asked
  for once per room rather than on every open.
- The read receipt is also sent when the app leaves the front with the room
  open - locking the screen used to leave everything just read unconfirmed,
  and the other side saw it as unread.
- Account -> Privacy also holds the four switches that used to sit in the
  account page: message text in notifications, other people's read status,
  voice messages, tappable web links. They all decide what leaves this device.
- Account -> Privacy: who may call (only people you have a direct chat with by
  default), calls from group rooms and video calls off, an allow list, and a
  switch for sending read receipts. Refused calls are dropped in the core, before
  anything rings, and are answered in no way the caller can observe; a caller
  rings at most once a minute. An offer with video now has two actions - the
  camera opens because the user chose it, never because the caller asked.
- Calls: the call identifier comes from the kernel's random source instead of a
  clock and a counter; an answer and its ICE candidates have to come from the
  room and from the party that answered; a "turns:" relay keeps its TLS instead
  of being rewritten to "turn:"; only the decoders a Matrix call needs may be
  plugged in; a remote video frame larger than 1920 pixels is dropped rather
  than allocated; hanging up a video call no longer risks a crash.
- The two lists that name people - who may call, and who the send warning is
  switched off for - are kept encrypted under the device's store key instead of
  in the plain settings file. What was there before moves over on the first
  start and is removed.
- Identifiers are blanked where an error leaves the core, not at the ninety-odd
  places that build one: a failed request used to carry the room and the user
  into the journal and into the error banner, because the HTTP error names the
  URL it failed on.
- Reading in emoji pictures: a run that cannot start keeps the checked set
  instead of dropping to the unchecked one, a picture whose size the decoder
  cannot state is refused, scalable pictures with entity definitions are
  refused, and the checksum is taken from the bytes that were written.
- Downloaded media can be deleted when the app closes, or as soon as it is not
  in front any more. Never by default, which is what it always did.
- Local data: the session file is written atomically, the store's databases and
  downloaded attachments are owner-only, sign-out deletes the media cache, and a
  recording is removed once it has been sent.
- Emoji in a message are drawn from the picture set, not only in reactions.
- Pinch zoom keeps the point between the fingers where it is.
- Emoji pictures can be read in from a folder (Appearance) instead of being
  copied onto the device by hand. Everything read in is checked: only files
  named after code points, only small ones, each decoded once and written out
  again as PNG, each with a checksum that is verified every time the picture
  is drawn. A picture that changed since is refused and the character is drawn
  instead, with a red line saying so. A set copied in by hand keeps working,
  unchecked as before.
- A quoted picture is quoted as a picture: the reply shows a thumbnail where
  it used to show the file name.
- "Copy room link" in the room's pull-down: the matrix.to address others can
  be pointed at, the room's own where it has one.
- "Read by" stands under every own message now, counting the people who have
  read at least that far, and a long press on that line unfolds their names.
- "Read by" now marks the newest own message the others have read up to. A
  receipt points at the newest event someone read, which in a running
  conversation is their own message, so nothing was ever marked before.
- A notification carries the message that arrived, not the one before it. The
  count rises a pass earlier than the text, so the banner now waits for the
  text and goes out as a count only if none comes.

* Tue Aug 25 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.22.1-1
- A thread can be started: "Reply in thread" in a message's menu. Until now
  only threads other clients had opened could be answered.

* Mon Aug 24 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.22.0-1
- Reactions: shown grouped with a count, sent and taken back by tapping,
  "React" in a message's menu. Drawn as the characters they are; picture files
  of your own can be used instead (Appearance, off, nothing shipped).
- The caption of a picture is shown, and editing it keeps the picture. An
  attachment is saved under its file name, not under its caption.
- A room counts as read while it is read, opens where reading stopped, and can
  be marked read from the chat list. Other people's read status optional
  (Account, off).
- Tapping a notification opens the room it names.
- Matrix links open in the app: permalink, matrix: URI or #room:server. The tap
  never joins by itself.
- A message that failed to send can be sent again or discarded.
- Direction-control characters are removed from messages, names, previews and
  file names.
- Simplified Chinese and Hindi added; 29 languages.
- The microphone next to the message field can be switched off.
- Shorter menus: five entries in the chat list, the four ways into a room on
  their own page.

* Sat Aug 22 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.21.0-1
- Formatted messages are shown as formatting instead of as raw text. Bold,
  italic, code blocks, quotes, lists, headings and links now render; what a
  message carries as HTML is rewritten inside the app into the small markup
  Qt can draw, character by character, so nothing a sender wrote is ever
  handed to a markup parser. Pictures in a message body become their
  description rather than a download, sender-chosen colours are dropped, and
  a link keeps its target only if that target is an ordinary web address -
  whether it can be tapped at all is still the setting under Account.
- The app now says when it is storing your session and messages unencrypted.
  It has always fallen back to unencrypted storage when the device's secure
  storage would not hand out a key, and it has always said so only in the
  system log, which is not somewhere anyone looks. The encryption page names
  the state and the reason. Where an encrypted store is possible but the
  existing one predates it, it also offers the one operation that works:
  sign out, sign back in. That deletes this device's keys, so it is refused
  unless a key backup exists on the server.
- Two copies of the app can no longer run on the same data. The client runs
  its database without the SDK's cross-process lock, which is a deliberate
  choice - the lock cost about fifty disk syncs per second while idle - but
  it is only safe with one process, and nothing was enforcing that. A lock
  file taken before the database opens does now; a second start hands over to
  the running one.
- The recovery key is treated like the login password on its way into the
  app: the buffer that carried it is overwritten, and the core wipes its own
  copy. A key that was just generated has to stay readable long enough to
  write it down, so that one is only dropped when the page closes.
- The interface is available in the twenty-four official languages of the
  European Union, in Russian, Norwegian and Icelandic. It also no longer
  simply follows the phone: Account now has a language of its own, English
  included, because most of these are machine translations and one has to be
  able to get back out of them. A change takes effect the next time the app
  starts. Norwegian is the exception - most of it was contributed by a
  Norwegian speaker, and German is the other one that has been read by one.

* Fri Aug 21 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.20.0-1
- A new room is now described completely at the moment it is created, because
  that is the only moment the server accepts most of it: topic, a public
  address people can type elsewhere, who may read the history, whom to invite
  right away, whether only moderators may write, whether everyone invited
  starts with the creator's rights, and whether the room stays on this server.
  Encryption stays where it was, as the one decision that cannot be undone.
- A message that cannot be decrypted now says why. The reason was there all
  along - the protocol library works it out and hands it over - and it was
  being thrown away, so every case read the same. The one that matters is
  "the sender did not share the key because they consider this device
  insecure", which names a setting on the other side instead of leaving both
  people guessing.
- Six dialogs were stuck in portrait on a device that is held sideways, among
  them the warning about unverified recipients, which appeared rotated by
  ninety degrees. They turn with the device now, and the short ones scroll so
  their input field cannot end up behind the keyboard.
- Tapping a quote jumps to the message it quotes. That was never wired up at
  all, and the same jump used by "show in conversation" for a pinned message
  only ever worked when the message happened to be loaded already: it waited
  for the row count to change, and a page of history that renders as nothing -
  a stretch of membership changes does it - never changes that count. It now
  retries on its own and says so when the message is beyond the loaded
  history, instead of doing nothing at all.
- A picture can carry a caption, and an answer can carry a picture. Picking a
  file used to send it on the spot, which made all three impossible at once:
  no caption, no reply, and no way back after tapping the wrong thumbnail.
  There is now a page between picking and sending that shows what is about to
  go out, quotes the message being answered, and takes the caption. Both
  belong there because neither can be added afterwards.

- Every member has a profile page now, one level below the member list.
  Tapping a member, or a sender's picture in a conversation, opens it: the
  picture at full size, the address to copy with a tap, the role, since when
  they are a member and who invited them, the rooms you share, and whether
  their encryption identity is trusted. That last one has four answers, not
  two - the one worth knowing is "the identity changed since you verified
  it", which is shown in red together with the way out.
- Moderation moved onto that page: removing, banning and lifting a ban,
  making somebody a moderator or an admin. Each entry only appears where the
  room's power levels allow it, and making an admin asks first, because it
  cannot be taken back.
- Threads. A message that starts one carries a marker with the number of
  replies, a reply inside one says so, and both open a page of their own
  with its own composer. Replies in threads keep appearing in the
  conversation as well, so nothing is hidden from anybody who never opens
  the thread page.
- A notification now disappears when the room is read somewhere else. Read
  receipts travel between clients, so reading on a desktop clears the count
  here - and with the notification the banner, the feed entry and the
  communication LED go too, instead of claiming a message is still waiting.
- A reply whose quoted message cannot be loaded says so, rather than showing
  an ellipsis for good. That happens when the quoted event lives on a server
  ours cannot fetch it from, or history visibility forbids it.
- The account's ignored users are listed under Account, with a tap to stop
  ignoring somebody. The list belongs to the account and holds in every
  client. The send warning's "do not warn me about this user again" can be
  taken back there too - it promised that and had nowhere to do it.
- Room info offers renegotiating the encryption: the next message starts a
  fresh session and hands its key to every device again. The remedy when the
  other side reports it cannot read what this device sends.
- A homeserver that cannot do the sync this app needs is now named as such.
  Before, every sync failed, the offline mode turned that into "offline",
  and the banner flashed over an empty room list - which reads as a network
  fault and is not one. The app asks the server on start and says plainly
  that it is not supported.
- Sign-in failures say what went wrong. A server that only offers its own
  web sign-in (SSO), which this app cannot use yet, is no longer reported
  the same way as a wrong password.
- Security: text that other people write - display names, room names, server
  error messages - is rendered as plain text everywhere. A display name
  could previously contain markup, and a picture in it was fetched on sight.
  Error messages no longer carry room, user or event identifiers into the
  device log.

* Thu Aug 20 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.18.3-1
- Idle no longer costs measurable CPU. The client held a cross-process store
  lock whose lease was rewritten into the crypto store every 50 ms - about
  fifty disk syncs per second, guarding against a second process that the
  single-instance launcher already rules out. The lock is single-process now;
  measured idle load fell from 3.4% to 0.3%, and the flash is left alone.
- Web links in messages can be tapped, behind a new switch under Account,
  off by default: a tapped link opens the browser, and that is attack
  surface one opts into. Only http(s) ever becomes a link, the shown text is
  the target itself, and message bodies are still never rendered as markup.
- The notification banner no longer shows the quoted message for edited
  replies. The edit fallback hid the quote block from the preview's
  stripper, so the banner could show readers their own words as if they
  were the news.
* Tue Aug 18 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.18.2-1
- The room search keeps the keyboard. Every letter re-filters the list and
  the list comes back as a full reset; on each reset the list view recreated
  its current row and handed that row the focus, taking the keyboard from the
  search field in the header. The list has no current row any more, so there
  is nothing to hand the focus to - measured on the device, no loss in thirty
  keystrokes where before it was every one. The room directory search had the
  same layout and gets the same fix. (The 0.9.1 hand-back ran before the
  focus was taken and therefore never did anything.)
- Profile pictures are round. They were square with a highlight-coloured ring
  drawn across them - on the stock ambience a light-blue circle on every room
  icon - because a rectangular clip cannot round an image. A proper mask does.
- A notification can carry the message. Off by default, because the banner
  also lands on the lock screen; the switch is under Account -> This app. On,
  the banner shows the latest text (a picture, file, voice message or
  location is named as such, an undecryptable event says so) instead of the
  count.
- The appearance page has a visible "Reset to defaults" button - the entry
  in its pull-down was easy to miss - and the opacity slider follows a reset
  and a change of element instead of keeping its last dragged position.

* Tue Aug 18 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.18.1-1
- Password sign-in no longer flickers into an empty room list: the sign-in
  reset the local store a second time, under the client it went on to use.
  The reset now belongs to whoever builds the client.
- A missing store key is a locked session, never a re-login. The key in the
  device's secrets storage is released only through the system's own
  approval dialog, which the app never allowed to appear — so after a reboot
  the encrypted session read as "no session", the login page came up and the
  sign-in cleared the store: a new device and a recovery-key round for every
  affected user. The app now asks with the system dialog (once per boot),
  logs the storage's reason, never replaces a key while encrypted data
  exists, and shows a "Locked" page with a retry when the key is not at
  hand.

* Sun Aug 16 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.18.0-1
- A room can ask for mentions only, right here: the room page's mute switch
  became a four-way choice — account default, every message, mentions and
  keywords only, muted. Stored with the account's push rules, so it holds in
  every client, and the banner already follows it.
- The conversation's colours are the user's now. A new appearance page under
  Account offers one spectrum field with a circle marker, a grey ramp, a hex
  code that reads and types, and RGB sliders for the fine end; a selector
  says what is being coloured — either bubble, the sender name, either text
  colour — plus an opacity slider for the bubble fills. Everything defaults
  to following the ambience, a live preview shows the effect first, and one
  pull-down entry resets the lot.

* Sun Aug 16 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.17.2-1
- Notifications follow the account's push rules. A room set to "mentions
  only" — in any client, the rule lives on the account — no longer banners
  and sounds for every message: only the events the rules say should notify
  raise the banner, and the banner counts those. The unread badge and the
  cover deliberately keep counting everything.
- The message text no longer reads its own laid-out width back, which the
  device journal reported as a binding loop on every wrapped message.

* Sun Aug 16 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.17.1-1
- The bar of a reply quote now runs down its left side instead of across its
  top. The horizontal bar separated two identically styled names in a
  received bubble — the author above it, the quoted sender below — and which
  was which was anyone's guess.

* Sun Aug 16 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.17.0-1
- A reply shows what it answers even when that message first has to be
  fetched: the quote holds its place while loading instead of collapsing,
  and a fetch the server refused gets one more try instead of staying empty
  forever.
- Own message bubbles, the quote inside them and the unread counters are
  readable on every ambience. Strong highlight fills swallowed their text on
  some colour schemes; bubbles and counter are now soft tints, a mention
  marks itself with a ring around the counter, and the number grew to a
  readable size.
- The cover no longer shows the account's identifier. Instead it counts what
  is new: rooms with unread messages over the messages themselves — 2/7 says
  seven new messages across two rooms.
- The About page can no longer name a build it is not: both of its version
  lines are forced into step with the package at build time, each having
  quietly gone stale once.

* Sat Aug 15 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.16.0-1
- Sign in with username and password on homeservers without OAuth. The login
  page detects what the server speaks and only then offers the password form;
  the password is never stored, logged or kept, and the process now refuses
  debugger and memory access from other apps.
- The session file and newly created local stores are encrypted with a key
  held in the device's secrets storage. The first start asks for permission
  once; without it the app keeps working exactly as before.

* Tue Aug 11 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.15.0-1
- A room that has been replaced now says so. When a room outgrows its version
  it is not migrated but replaced by a new one, and the old room keeps its
  history while silently accepting no new messages — it looked like a
  conversation that had merely gone quiet. The room list marks it, the room
  itself shows a banner, and one tap joins the room that took its place.
- New room-info page, opened by tapping the room's name: topic, address,
  members, encryption, access, room version and the internal room id, plus
  mute, favourite and low priority. The room's pull-down menu is shorter for
  it — ten entries were barely draggable on a small screen in landscape.

* Sat Aug 01 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.14.0-1
- A message written while the network was gone now leaves as soon as it comes
  back. The send queue switches itself off after a failed send and waits for
  the client to switch it on again; nothing did, so the message sat there until
  the app was restarted — and it looked sent the whole time. Messages that did
  not get out are marked as such.
- Pictures can no longer appear in the wrong room. Attachments were remembered
  under a row number that started again from zero in every room, so the first
  picture of one room could be shown in place of the first picture of the next.
- The timeline no longer freezes. Opening a room could deadlock the core, after
  which nothing in the conversation worked until the app was restarted.
- Verifying a device now unlocks the old messages it was verified for: the key
  backup announces itself through a stream the app did not listen to, so the
  keys were never fetched afterwards.
- A verification can be started again after one stalled. Asking a second time
  used to cancel both attempts.
- The warning before sending into an encrypted room no longer says "everything
  checked" when nothing was: a member whose devices were never downloaded is
  now asked for instead of counted as verified.
- Reading a room and running a verification or a call no longer cancel each
  other's event subscription, which had made calls unreliable and left
  verifications looking stalled.
- The sync service is restarted when it gives up, instead of leaving the app
  quietly offline until the next start.
- "Load older messages" is no longer greyed out because something unrelated is
  loading, and the automatic history fetch stops instead of asking forever.
- Stickers and polls are visible instead of empty rows; quotes of older
  messages fill in; the room directory survives a dropped page; the pinned view
  no longer reports an error when there is nothing more to load.

* Fri Jul 31 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.13.0-1
- Rooms can be created. "New room" in the chat list's pulldown asks for a name
  and settles the two things that cannot be changed the same way afterwards:
  whether the room is listed in the homeserver's directory or open by
  invitation only, and whether it is end-to-end encrypted.
- People can be invited into a room by their address, from the room's pulldown
  menu. They show up in the member list as invited until they accept.
- A room can be left — from its row in the chat list or from the room itself,
  both after a remorse timer. On a room you were only invited to, the same
  entry declines the invitation.

* Fri Jul 31 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.12.1-1
- A room stayed silent after it had been opened once: notifications were
  suppressed for the room the app had last visited rather than for the one on
  screen, so exactly the room being tested never made a sound until some other
  room was opened.
- A room left open while the phone is on the cover notifies again.

* Fri Jul 31 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.12.0-1
- Profile pictures: in the chat list, in a room's member list and next to
  other people's messages. A one-to-one chat shows the other person even when
  the room itself carries no picture, and a name without one gets a circle
  with its initial instead of a gap.
- Names and pictures of message senders are complete now; before, they
  appeared for some people and not others depending on what had been synced.
- A message's menu no longer runs off the screen in landscape. There it keeps
  copy and reply and moves everything else — including delete — onto a page of
  its own, which is reachable. Upright the menu is unchanged.

* Fri Jul 31 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.11.1-1
- A new message is audible again: the notification carried no category, and on
  Sailfish the tone, the vibration and the light all hang off that. It now uses
  the system's instant-messaging category, so the tone chosen in the settings
  plays. Should it stay quiet, check that chat sounds are switched on under
  Settings, Sounds and feedback — the app does not override that.
- A message arriving while the phone is in hand shows a banner instead of only
  an entry in the event feed.

* Fri Jul 31 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.11.0-1
- xmatic is offered in the system's share dialog: a link from the browser, a
  picture from the gallery or a file from the file manager can be sent
  straight into a room. Picking the room opens it, so what was sent is
  visible. Sharing also works when the app was not running.
- Muting a room takes effect where it is switched: the marker and the menu
  entry used to keep the old state until the room was opened or the app
  restarted, although the room was muted on the server all along.
- A muted room no longer raises notifications. The mute was written to the
  server's push rules, which the app does not use for its own banners, so a
  muted room went on notifying exactly as before.
- Unmuting works for accounts whose default is to mute everything; until now
  it removed the room's own rule and left the default in charge.
- Muted rooms have their own marker instead of sharing the low-priority one.

* Fri Jul 31 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.10.0-1
- New app icon: the X is gone — it read as the social network's logo rather
  than as this app. In its place, glyphs falling in columns behind a white m,
  on the silhouette the system's own icons use.
- The room's menu is reachable from anywhere in the conversation: the room
  name sits in a fixed strip at the top of the page, and pulling that strip
  down opens the menu. Reaching it no longer means scrolling back through
  the whole history.
- That strip also says whether the room is encrypted, and shows when the app
  has lost the network.
- Tapping the strip opens the room's member list.

* Fri Jul 31 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.9.1-1
- Older messages load in rooms that were joined while the app was running:
  such a room arrived without any history and stopped at its first events.
- A conversation too short to fill the screen fetches history on its own
  instead of waiting for a scroll that cannot happen.
- The pinned-message banner stays one line high; a multi-line pin no longer
  covers the conversation.
- The pinned view says when the server refuses to hand out the pinned
  messages instead of claiming there are none.
- The attachment picker can be used in landscape.

* Thu Jul 30 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.9.0-1
- Room list: favourites group to the top, low-priority rooms to the bottom,
  everything else stays in activity order. Rooms can be marked favourite or
  low priority from their context menu; low-priority rooms no longer raise
  notifications. Encrypted, favourite and low-priority each show their own icon.
- The room search field keeps focus while filtering.
- The message composer scrolls to the cursor instead of pushing long text
  out of view.
- Encrypted rooms warn before sending to a recipient whose devices you have
  not verified, with an option to stop warning about that user.

* Tue Jul 28 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.8.0-1
- Runs on 32-bit devices: an armv7hl build for Sailfish OS 4.6 (Gemini PDA).
- Sign in on another device: an OAuth device-code flow for devices whose
  own browser cannot render the login pages.
- Voice and video calls receive audio and video reliably, including on the
  Gemini: the received call stream is routed to the speaker and unmuted, and
  the Android hardware video decoder (which refuses the stream) is bypassed.
- New direct chats are end-to-end encrypted from creation; existing rooms
  can turn encryption on.
- About page shows the app and core version.

* Sun Jul 26 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.4.0-1
- Own profile: display name and avatar can be changed in the app.
- Rooms can be muted and unmuted; muted rooms show a small marker.
- Messages queued while offline are sent automatically on reconnect.
- Pinned messages: pin from the conversation, a banner with the newest
  pin's text sticks to the top of the room, own page per room, jump
  from a pinned message into the history around it.
- Pure profile changes no longer show as a system row in every room.
- Public room directory: search, preview (topic, member count), join.
- Spaces list their linked-but-not-joined rooms as joinable.

* Sun Jul 26 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.3.1-1
- Sync recovers on its own after a network loss (flight mode, dead WLAN):
  the sync service now runs in offline mode and reconnects when the server
  is reachable again. The room list and space overview show an offline note
  while it does.

* Sat Jul 25 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.3.0-1
- Spaces: own navigation level, create/delete, organise rooms by long-press,
  move between spaces, unread badges, choice of start page. Timeline system
  rows for calls and membership changes. German translations.

* Fri Jul 24 2026 harbour-xmatic contributors 0.2.0-1
- Messaging, encryption, verification, key backup, attachments, voice messages,
  notifications and voice calls.
