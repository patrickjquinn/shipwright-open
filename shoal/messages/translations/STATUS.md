# Translation status

Source language: English. One `.ts` per target; `.qm` is build output. A
language is listed in `TRANSLATIONS` only once it is actually translated —
an empty file would ship as coverage that is not there.

Beyond the EU: Russian, Norwegian Bokmål, Icelandic, Simplified Chinese,
Hindi, Japanese, Persian and Arabic. Chinese and Hindi were added for reach,
not because anyone asked - Chinese because it opens the app to people who do
not read English, Hindi because leaving out the second-largest language group
while shipping Maltese would be a strange thing to defend. Japanese, Persian
and Arabic followed the download figures: the store lists Japan, Iran, Saudi
Arabia and Ethiopia, and those four had nothing but the English fallback.
Amharic is not in yet - the font it needs is not certain on this platform.
All of them are unreviewed machine output, like most of the list.

Persian and Arabic are read right to left. The catalogues are complete; the
layout is not mirrored, so the text runs correctly inside each line while the
page still stands the way it does in English. That is a UI change of its own,
and it needs a device to be judged.

Not shipped, deliberately: `nn` (Norwegian Nynorsk), Sámi, Faroese, traditional
Chinese (`zh_TW` is its own file, not the same one in other characters), and
the other languages of India. Adding them means adding more unreviewed output.

`review` is the only column that matters. **machine** means generated in one
pass without a native speaker — usable, not verified.

| lang | language | review | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| en | English | source | identity catalogue, so the picker can override the device |
| de | German | native | project language |
| fi | Finnish | machine, reviewed once | 24 corrections, see below |
| sv | Swedish | machine, reviewed once | 1 correction |
| nb | Norwegian Bokmål | **contributed** | 385 of 491 strings from PR #1; the remaining 106 are newer than it and still machine. `nn_NO` falls back to this. |
| da | Danish | machine, spot-checked | 2 corrections |
| fr es it nl pt | | machine | |
| pl cs sk sl hr bg ru | | machine | plural forms checked against Qt's rule |
| el hu ro et lv lt is | | machine | |
| ga mt | Irish, Maltese | machine, low confidence | 3 and 4 plural forms; smallest corpora |
| zh_CN | Simplified Chinese | machine | one plural form; `Space` kept as the English term |
| hi | Hindi | machine, low confidence | one plural form; informal (तुम) throughout, as everywhere else |
| ja | Japanese | machine | one plural form; polite plain form (ですます) for sentences, bare nouns on buttons |
| fa | Persian | machine, low confidence | one plural form by Qt's rule - a second one is dropped by lupdate; **right-to-left, and the layout does not mirror yet** |
| ar | Arabic | machine, low confidence | six plural forms; **right-to-left, and the layout does not mirror yet** |

## Known corrections already applied

- fr `Cœur` → `Noyau` (heart vs. software core)
- ga `Croí` → `Croílár` (same)
- fi `asiakas` → `asiakasohjelma` (customer vs. client)
- nb/is/el/hu/es: GStreamer `pipeline` had become a plumbing pipe, a conveyor
  or "process"; kept as the GStreamer word, which is what a log search uses
- nb/da/fi "opacity" had become "transparency" — the slider's meaning inverted
- fi `tallennus` (the act of saving) → `tallennustila` (storage), `tallentaa`
  (save) → `nauhoittaa` (record), `käytössä` used for both "active" and
  "set up", `kuva` → `profiilikuva`

## Open, needs a native speaker

- nb mixes `tjener` and `server` — the contributed file does too (15 / 16), so
  the inconsistency is not the machine's. Worth one decision.
- nb `Boblegjennomsiktighet` (transparency) for *opacity*, from the contributed
  file. The machine pass had the same word and it was corrected to `dekkevne`
  before the PR turned up; the contributor's wording stands.
- fi inflects `Space` as a loanword (`spaceen`, `spacet`); every other language
  leaves it uninflected.
- `Homeserver` is translated literally in several languages, where it can read
  as "a server in your home".

## Terms deliberately not translated

`Matrix`, `MSC4186`, `simplified sliding sync`, `webrtcbin`, `GStreamer`.
`Space`/`Spaces` stays English in German; Norwegian translates it
(`romgruppe`), on the contributor's decision — a language may go either way.

## Getting a language reviewed

```sh
tools/translation-review.py nb > review-nb.md
```

A numbered sheet grouped by page, with the open questions for that language at
the top. Corrections come back as "217: ..."; apply them, then move the row in
the table above from `machine` to `native`.

## Checking a file

```sh
lrelease-qt5 translations/shipwright-shoal-messages-XX.ts
```

"Removed plural forms as the target language has less forms" means the file
carries more `<numerusform>` entries than Qt allows for that language — one for
Hungarian, three for Irish and most Slavic languages, four for Slovenian and
Maltese, two otherwise.
